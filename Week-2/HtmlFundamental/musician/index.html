        Singh's musical career began when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari, who
        felt that "Indian classical music was a dying tradition", insisted him
        to leave his hometown and participate in the reality show Fame Gurukul
        (2005) at the age of 18. He was eliminated by audience polling,
        finishing in sixth place.
