// Section 3 â€“ Abstraction and encpasulation:

// Create a class called BankAccount with properties accountNumber, balance, and accountHolderName. Then, create two subclasses called CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount, each of which extends BankAccount.

// Make the accountNumber, balance, and accountHolderName properties private by using the # symbol before their names.

// Implement the deposit() and withdraw() methods in the CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount subclasses. These methods should accept a amount parameter and update the balance property accordingly.

// However, for the SavingsAccount subclass, if the balance drops below zero after a withdrawal, the withdrawal should fail and the balance should not be updated.

// Implement the getBalance() method in both the CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount subclasses. This method should return the balance property.

// Finally, create instances of each subclass and call the deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance() methods on each instance, logging the result to the console.

  // Example usage:
  const checkingAccount = new CheckingAccount('CHK123', 1000, 'John Doe');
  checkingAccount.deposit(500);
  checkingAccount.withdraw(200);
