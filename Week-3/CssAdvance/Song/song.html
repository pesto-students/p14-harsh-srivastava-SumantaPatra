         Yesterday,<br> 
         All those backups seemed a waste of pay.<br>
         Now my database has gone away.<br>
         Oh I believe in yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
         Suddenly,<br>
         There's not half the files there used to be,<br>
         And there's a milestone hanging over me.<br> 
         The system crashed so suddenly.
      </p> 
      <p>
         I pushed something wrong,<br>
         What it was I could not say.<br>
         Now all my data's gone<br>
         And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
      </p>
      <p>
         Yesterday,<br> 
         The need for back-ups seemed so far away.<br>
         I knew my data was all here to stay,<br>
         Now I believe in yesterday.
